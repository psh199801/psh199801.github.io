# _Experience_
***
###  **HUAWEI & SJTU**, Research Engineer
Jan 2020 - Jun 2020
* Proposed a new mapping scheme for sparse neural network matrices to balance the ReRAM’s multiple-level-cell structure and embedded K-means algorithms while maintaining inference accuracy.
* Initiated a clustering method based on time-division multiplexing to aggregate columns of the matrix and offset ReRAM’s hardware restrictions with 200% less hardware cost.
* Prototyped a column-combining algorithm for CNN Pruning with over 20 times smaller sizes and less than 1% accuracy
loss on Keras. (ResNet-18 for CIFAR-10)

### **University of Florida**, Research Assistant
Jul 2019 - Aug 2019
* Extracted SPO (subject, predicate, and object) information from sentences based on Universal Dependencies (UD).
* Selected STS-B as the dataset and extracted SPOs to aggregate the key information of sentences for model training.
* Improved 15% similarity scores’ accuracy of each pair of sentences with chunk vectors than Bert model on a 0-5
continuous scale. Tested with 3600 pairs of sentences using Manhattan Distance.

### **High Concurrency Seckill API**
Jul 2021 - Aug 2021
* Used SpringBoot to build the seckill API in a high concurrency system. Completed the product list display, user
information verification, and the process of placing orders for goods after the seckill started.
* Exerted RESTful for endpoint design, Bootstrap for page layout, and jQuery for timing and interactions.
* Cached inventory information into Redis directly to shift the pressure of MySQL server and reduce network latency.
* Tested with 1000 threads by Jmeter, improved the concurrency performance by 10% with the stored procedure.

### **Student Management System**
Jun 2021
* Monitored and managed student account activities through a back-end application interacting with JSON.
* Applied Spring JPA, MyBatis to implement CRUD operations on student information stored on MySQL.
* Resolved security issues with Shiro for user authentication and portal validation.

### **Weenix Operating System**
Feb 2021 - May 2021
* Collaborated kernel code for threads, processes, and synchronization primitives, achieving multi-threading under
multiple processes with no kernel-mode preemption.
* Designed the virtual file system, providing a common interface between the operating system kernel and various
file systems through the same UNIX-style interface, like vfat, dev, proc, S5FS file systems.
* Implemented the virtual memory to manage user address spaces, run user-level code, and service system calls.

### RPC(Remote Procedure Call) based on Netty
Dec 2020 - Jan 2021
* Fulfilled a lightweight RPC framework, using Spring to provide dependency injection and parameter configuration.
* Originated the RPC server with ZooKeeper to deliver service registration and discovery.
* Utilized Netty to implement NIO data transfer and Protostuff to execute object serialization.
